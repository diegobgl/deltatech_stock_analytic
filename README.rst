-  Features:

   -  An analytic account can be assign to a stock location
   -  At stock move confirmation, if both source and destination
      locations have analytics accounts set, two analytics line are
      created: one with plus (+) sign on the source location analytic
      and one with minus (-) sign on the destination location analytic.
   -  The values for the analytic lines are computed from the stoc move
      price unit or, if not present, from the product cost price
